# Code Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

Split the monolithic `index.html` file (3326 lines) into separate, maintainable files for easier editing.

## New File Structure

```
trader/
├── index.html              # Main HTML file (now ~3000 lines, reduced by ~300 lines)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css          # All custom CSS styles
├── js/
│   ├── config.js           # Configuration constants
│   └── database.js         # SQLite database logic
└── [other existing files...]
```

## Files Created

### 1. `css/styles.css`
- **Purpose**: All custom CSS styling for the dark theme
- **Contents**:
  - Dark background with messy white lines pattern
  - Tailwind color overrides for dark theme
  - Card backgrounds with subtle textures
  - Responsive design styles

### 2. `js/config.js`
- **Purpose**: All configuration constants in one place
- **Contents**:
  - Stripe payment links
  - Stock lists (POPULAR_STOCKS, TOP_12_STOCKS)
  - Finnhub API credentials
  - Trading configuration (COMMISSION_RATE, COOLDOWN_MS)
  - Stock database for search
  - Fallback stock data

### 3. `js/database.js`
- **Purpose**: All SQLite database operations
- **Contents**:
  - `initDatabase()` - Initialize SQL.js and create tables
  - `saveDatabase()` - Save to localStorage
  - `SQLiteDB` object with methods:
    - `createAccount()`
    - `getAccount()`
    - `getAccountByEmailAndPasscode()`
    - `getAccountByEmail()`
    - `updateAccount()`
    - `getAllAccounts()`

## Changes to `index.html`

### Added
- Link to external CSS: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">`
- Script tags for external JS:
  - `<script src="js/config.js"></script>`
  - `<script src="js/database.js"></script>`
- Auto-initialize database on page load

### Removed
- ~150 lines of inline CSS
- ~150 lines of database initialization code
- ~100 lines of configuration constants

## Benefits

1. **Easier Editing**: Each concern is now in its own file
2. **Better Organization**: CSS, configuration, and database logic are separated
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to styles or config don't require editing the main HTML
4. **Readability**: Main HTML file is now shorter and focused on React components
5. **Reusability**: Config and database modules can be easily updated or replaced

## How to Use

The application works exactly the same as before. Simply open `index.html` in a browser or deploy to a web server. All external files are loaded automatically.

## Testing

Tested with local HTTP server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

All files load correctly and the application functions as expected.

## Future Improvements (Optional)

If you want to further split the code:
- Extract utility functions into `js/utils.js`
- Extract stock API functions into `js/stockAPI.js`
- Extract React components into separate files (requires build system like Vite)

For now, this minimal split provides the best balance between organization and simplicity while maintaining the current Babel-in-browser setup.
