### Option 2: Run Locally

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. The app runs entirely in the browser using SQL.js (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly).

### Option 3: Local Development with Email Server

To enable password reset functionality locally, you need to run the email server:

#### Step 1: Configure Email Settings

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your email credentials:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
   PORT=3001
   ```

   **For Gmail users:**
   - Use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) instead of your regular password
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
   - Generate an App Password in Security Settings

#### Step 2: Start the Email Server

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

#### Step 3: Test Password Reset

1. Create a personal account in the app
2. Go to the login page
3. Click "Forgot your passcode?"
4. Enter your email address
5. Check your email for the passcode

```

## Security Notes

- Passcodes are stored in plain text in browser localStorage (this is a demo app)
- For production use, implement proper authentication with hashed passwords
- Never commit your `.env` file - it contains sensitive email credentials
- Use app-specific passwords, never your main email password

## Development

### Running Without Email Server

The app works perfectly fine without the email server. Password reset will show an error, but all other features work normally:

- Create accounts
- Login with email + passcode
- Trade stocks
- Join competitions
- View leaderboard

### Testing Locally

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Create a test account
3. Make some trades
4. Your data is saved in browser localStorage
